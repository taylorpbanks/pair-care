      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you trying to figure out which baby wipes to purchase? It may seem straightforward but not all baby wipes are equal and they are not only super convenient but arguably essential. Washcloths are also a good eco-friendly alternative but keep in mind you will need multiple washcloths and need to frequently do laundry (unless you use a specialty service). We&rsquo;ll explore both options in this post to help you determine the best option for your baby since you're trying to figure out...everything else. You want your baby to get the best, and sometimes the wrong baby wipes can cause irritation, allergic reactions, and other issues so it&rsquo;s important to pay attention to what wipes you use.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&rsquo;ve included a list of some of the best baby wipes for your baby and what ingredients to avoid so you can make an informed decision about the best options, even if you&rsquo;ve never bought a box or pack of baby wipes in your life.</span></p>

      <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-Toxic Material Baby Wipes</span></h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is no big surprise but newborns and babies have sensitive skin. You should look for wipes that don&rsquo;t contain toxic materials and are all-natural.</span></p>

      <h2>How to Choose Baby Wipes</h2>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, look at all of the wipe ingredients &mdash; while all wipes should be nontoxic, you may want to go with an organic or hypoallergenic variant, for extra safety. You also want to keep in mind your budget and how many wipes come in a pack, as well as if wipes are available in a bulk quantity for less. Of course, reusable cloth wipes are the most budget-friendly option over time, in addition to being the most environmentally friendly.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be surprised to discover that many baby wipes contain toxic ingredients. Many wipes contain chemicals that are used as fragrance mixes to mask bad smells, preservatives, or penetration enhancers. Some toxic ingredients can be difficult to spot or find on product packaging. We&rsquo;ve compiled a list of toxic ingredients to look for and avoid when looking for baby wipes.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>FORMALDEHYDE-RELEASING CHEMICALS</strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formaldehyde is a carcinogen that may not only cause cancer but can also damage the central nervous system and reproductive organs. Formaldehyde can be absorbed into the body by inhalation, by the skin itself or by ingestion. Sometimes, a product will not contain formaldehyde as an ingredient on it&rsquo;s label but it will contain formaldehyde releasing chemicals. Often cosmetics, soaps, baby wipes, lotions, shampoos, cleaning products and sunscreens will contain formaldehyde releasing chemicals as preservatives. Therefore, unless you know what these chemicals are, you won&rsquo;t know these products release formaldehyde.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formaldehyde releasing chemicals that are used as preservatives in products are as follows.</span></p>
      <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benzylhemiformal</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tosylamide/Formaldehyde Resin</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5-bromo-5-nitro-1,3-dioxane</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diazolidinyl urea</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glyoxal</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1,3-dimethylol-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (or DMDM hydantoin)</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Methenamine</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imidazolidinyl urea</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sodium hydroxymethylglycinate</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quaternium-15</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DMDM Hydantoin</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polyoxymethylene Urea</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      When it comes to choosing the right options for your newborn, both baby wipes and otherwise, it pays to do your research. Keep in mind your baby’s individual needs like skin conditions, allergies, or other sensitivities.
      </p><p>What’s best for one baby may might not necessarily be best for another, and when it comes to something as delicate as baby wipes, you want to make sure you’re making a good choice, whether that means going with traditional baby wipes, cloth wipes, hypoallergenic wipes, or any other option available. Also - make sure to not fall for pleasant sounding words like ‘sensitive’ or ‘hypoallergenic’ since they don't mean baby wipes don’t contain toxic ingredients and always choose ‘fragrance-free’, not ‘unscented’ when buying baby wipes.</p>`

      html: `<p>While diapers are not the sexiest of items, we can guarantee that it is on your top five list of non-negotiable items but where does one begin? Are you an eco-warrior and plan to use reusable diapers? Would you rather not deal with the mess making you a fan of the disposables? Also don&rsquo;t forget trainers and swimmers!</p>
<p>What are the right diapers for me?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to limit the baby &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; you have? Are you comfortable with running the wash or cleaning more? Do you want to avoid single use products? If yes, you would be a fan of the reusable diaper.</li>
<li>Do you prefer the</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the basics.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How many diapers do I need</strong>? Newborns can have up to 4 bowel movements a day with other wettings in between. Expect to change your baby&rsquo;s diaper anywhere between 8-12 times a day.</li>
<li><strong>Disposable diapers: what is the difference between newborn (N) and size 1</strong>? Diaper sizes will have a range based on the baby&rsquo;s weight. Newborn size, or size &ldquo;N,&rdquo; will typically be for newborns who are less than 10lbs. If you find that your baby is born on the higher weight range it may be best to jump straight into the size 1s. This will eliminate you are not left with too many N size diapers that you won&rsquo;t use.</li>
<li><strong>Reusable diapers: what are the sizing considerations</strong>? There are many brands that have built their set of reusable diapers to grow with your child. Make sure the diaper is secured tight enough around the legs and stomach to avoid leaking</li>
<li><strong>Disposable diaper 101:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you are ever in between two sizes there usually is a number indicator on the diaper. May take a second to find but it&rsquo;s there.</li>
<li>Tabs are the back of the diaper so you can pull and attach to the front</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Diaper accessories and the Pair Care recommendation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diaper pail &ndash; Yes if you plan on only taking trash out once in a while, diapers can also be thrown in regular trash so long as you plan on removing frequently</li>
<li>Changing dresser &ndash; We recommend getting a dresser and securing a changing pad on top</li>
<li>Changing pad &ndash; Recommend any pad that is wipeable. It&rsquo;s a no fuss way to quickly clean what can become a messy situation regardless of using reusable or disposable</li>
<li>Baby wipe warmer &ndash; Not a Pair Care essential. If you travel you don&rsquo;t want to have this be yet another item to bring on the road. Babies can get used to the coldness of the cloth. To also prevent some post diaper leakage place a baby cloth on the stomach while the diaper is on so that the baby can release any urine reacting from the cold wipe.</li>
<li>Diaper organizer &ndash; Yes, anything that makes it easier to grab wipes, diapers and creams is a yes for us! Whether that is a caddy or organized compartments in a drawer it is highly recommended.</li>

      html: `<p>The world is full of choices, and yes opinions, on what your child should be eating. You can grab an assortment of pre-made baby food and snacks from any big box store aisle such as Walmart and Target and of course there is Amazon. You can also go completely au natural and make your own delectable assortment of foods. But let&rsquo;s not forget the middle ground. You can combine pre-made food with food you&rsquo;ve made or even outsource the work of pre-made fresh food. The question comes down to three things how much time do you want to spend, how much money do you want to spend and how much control do you want over the nutritional value. Here are some of our favorites for each type of food path.</p>
<p><u>For the parents who want to cut down on time: </u></p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard there were reports of toxic heavy metals in baby foods. Some folks even took it to social media to demonstrate the simple act of using a magnet and pulling small fragments of metal from their purchase kid foods. Now there are class action lawsuits against Plum (a Campbell brand), Gerber, Beech-Nut and Hain. Fear not, US lawmakers are introducing The Baby Food Safety Act of 2021 that will limit toxic heavy metals in baby food which includes mercury, lead, inorganic arsenic and cadmium. The good news is there are a plethora of brands outside of the four listed in which you can stock up on for your little one.</p>
<p>We love the variety from the happy family of products. From teether crackers to food pouches to their warmup meals. You&rsquo;ll feel great about the options, and they do a great job of incorporating healthy foods such as quinoa, chia, and a variety of vegetables.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>For the parents who prefers to be their own chef: </u></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need something to steam your food, blend it all up, and store. You can do as simple as getting a steamer basket, using a blender you may already have (Immersion Blender, Nutribullet, Vitamix, etc.), and store in Tupperware that you already have. If you want an upgrade on some times that help combines some steps.</p>

<p><u>For the parents who wants to hire someone else to be the chef: </u></p>
<p>While this market is only getting more saturated one brand that has stood out to us is Yumi. It&rsquo;s as easy as picking a plan, they prep, cook, and ship to you. Voila you have a week supply of food! And it&rsquo;s as simple as they ship fresh food EVERY week. Yumi has amazing customer service and have developed a food plan (7 stages) that adapts to your baby&rsquo;s likes while also allowing them to try new things. New things that even you may not have tried yourself such as adzuki bean, Japanese sweet potato, dragon fruit, and more. They also pride themselves on being no gluten, dairy, big 9 allergens, GMO, added sugars, or fortified so you have even less to worry about if you have specific dietary guidelines you wish to follow.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, similar to one&rsquo;s birth plan, expect to be flexibility or you will drive yourself mad. Remember that your child has their own taste preferences. As a parent you can do your best to make sure they develop the best pallet, but it is always best when our little ones have full stomachs and happy hearts.</p>
